# Lighter TodoMVC Example

> Lighter is a lightweight Node.js framework for web applications and APIs. When used for web applications, Lighter will render views either on the server or the client. This functionality will allow Lighter to optimize for low latency. The first request to your web app renders HTML and returns it to the browser, then views are lazy-loaded into the client so that subsequent requests only need to return JSON that the client can render using its cached views.
